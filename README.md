- 👋 Hi, I’m @rianluoar
- 👀 I’m interested in Debugging other people's code, creating algorithms that make no sense, and pretending to know what I'm doing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning How to train a neural network to predict when my boss will ask for something last minute.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on A program that will write my code for me, so I can finally take a break and binge-watch Netflix.
- 📫 How to reach me Just shout "Hello World" into the void, and I'll be sure to respond with a cryptic error message. Alternatively, you can try emailing me at dont.bother.me@imcoding.com, but I can't promise I'll actually check it.
